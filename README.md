🚇📊 Excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard! 📊🚇
I just completed a Post-COVID MTA Ridership Analysis Dashboard, designed from the perspective of commuters. This interactive report highlights key insights into ridership recovery trends, category-wise distribution, and the shift in commuter behavior over the years.
🚆 Key Takeaways:
 ✅ Ridership is steadily recovering, with 7.93 billion total commuters in 2024.
 ✅ Bridges & Tunnels have surpassed pre-pandemic levels, while subways, buses, and rail lines are on a strong recovery path.
 ✅ Weekday vs. Weekend commuting patterns are evolving, showing an upward trend in weekend travel.
 ✅ Seasonal trends impact recovery rates, with autumn seeing the highest rebound.
This project was a great opportunity to apply my Power BI skills and dive into public transportation analytics! 🚀
